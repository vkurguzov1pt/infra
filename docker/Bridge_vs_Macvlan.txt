Use Macvlan:

    - When you only need to provide egress connection to the physical network to your VMs or containers.
    - Because it uses less host CPU and provides slightly better throughput.

Use Bridge:

    - When you need to connect VMs or containers on the same host.
    - For complex topologies with multiple bridges and hybrid environments (hosts in the same Layer2 domain both on the same host and outside the host).
    - You need to apply advanced flood control, FDB manipulation, etc.
